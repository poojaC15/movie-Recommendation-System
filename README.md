A movie recommendation system is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users film preferences based on their past choices and behavior.The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The recommendation system analyzes the past preferences of the user concerned, and then it uses this information to try to find similar movies. This information is available in the database. After that, the system provides movie recommendations for the user.
